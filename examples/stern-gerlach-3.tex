\section*{Stern-Gerlach 3}

From the previous sections we have
\begin{equation*}
\Psi=\begin{pmatrix}\psi_1\\\psi_2\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation*}

where
\begin{align*}
\psi_1&=\operatorname{Ai}\left[
\left(\frac{\alpha e}{2\hbar}\right)^{1/3}
\frac{\alpha e\hbar}{8m^2}\,t^2
+\left(\frac{\alpha e}{2\hbar}\right)^{1/3}z\right]
\exp\left(-\frac{ie\alpha zt}{4m}\right)
\exp\left(-\frac{ieB_0t}{2m}\right)
\\[1ex]
\psi_2&=\operatorname{Ai}\left[
\left(\frac{\alpha e}{2\hbar}\right)^{1/3}
\frac{\alpha e\hbar}{8m^2}\,t^2
-\left(\frac{\alpha e}{2\hbar}\right)^{1/3}z\right]
\exp\left(+\frac{ie\alpha zt}{4m}\right)
\exp\left(+\frac{ieB_0t}{2m}\right)
\end{align*}

The probability density for silver atoms is
\begin{equation*}
f(t,z)=\Psi^\dag\Psi=|\psi_1|^2+|\psi_2|^2
\end{equation*}

The following plots show the time evolution
of silver atom density.
Because we are using a polynomial approximation
for the Airy function, it is necessary to use
small values of deflection, i.e., $25\,\text{$\mu$m}$.
