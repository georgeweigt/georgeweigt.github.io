# Step 3. Calculate the Riemann tensor. Cf. Gravitation, p. 219.

#
# Contract over "a" (1st and 3rd indices).

# Step 5: Calculate the Ricci scalar. Cf. Gravitation, p. 343.
#
#      uv
# R = g   R
#          vu  ...the book has uv, does it give the same result?
#              Yes because the metric tensor is symmetric so it's ok to
#              transpose.

R = contract(contract(outer(guu,RDD),2,3),1,2)

# Step 6: Finally, calculate the Einstein tensor. Cf. Gravitation, p. 343.

#  uv    uv        uv

GDD = RDD - 1/2 gdd R
