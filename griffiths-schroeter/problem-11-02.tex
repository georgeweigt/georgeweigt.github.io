11.2
A hydrogen atom is placed in a (time-dependent) electric field
$\mathbf E=E(t)\hat k$.
Calculate all four matrix elements $H_{ij}'$ of the perturbation
$\hat H'=eEz$ between the ground state ($n=1$) and the (quadruply degenerate)
first excited states ($n=2$). Also show that
$H_{ii}'=0$ for all five states.
{\it Note:} There is only one integral to be done here, if you exploit
oddness with respect to $z$; only one of the $n=2$ states is ``accessible''
from the ground state by a perturbation of this form, and therefore the
system functions as a two-state configuration---assuming transitions
to higher excited states can be ignored.
}

In polar form
\begin{equation*}
\hat H'=eE(t)\,r\cos\theta
\end{equation*}

The matrix elements are
\begin{align*}
\langle\psi_{2,0,0}|\hat H'|\psi_{1,0,0}\rangle&=0
\\
\langle\psi_{2,1,0}|\hat H'|\psi_{1,0,0}\rangle&=\tfrac{128}{243}\sqrt2a_0eE(t)
\\
\langle\psi_{2,1,1}|\hat H'|\psi_{1,0,0}\rangle&=0
\\
\langle\psi_{2,1,-1}|\hat H'|\psi_{1,0,0}\rangle&=0
\end{align*}

The unit of electric field is volts per meter.

The dimension of $a_0eE(t)$ is joules.
So somehow this has to get cancelled to get a dimensionless probability.

Answer: Divide by $\hbar$ to get hertz, then integrate over time.
\begin{equation*}
\Pr(t)=\left|\int_0^te^{i\Delta\omega t'}
\frac{\frac{128}{243}\sqrt2a_0eE(t')}{i\hbar}\,dt'\right|^2
\end{equation*}
