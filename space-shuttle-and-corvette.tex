The space shuttle accelerates from zero to 17,000 miles per hour
in 8 minutes.
A Corvette accelerates from zero to 60 miles per hour in 4.5 seconds.
The following script compares the two.

\begin{verbatim}
"Average space shuttle acceleration"
vs = 17000 "mile" / "hr"
ts = 8 "min" / (60 "min" / "hr")
as = vs / ts
as
"Average Corvette acceleration"
vc = 60 "mile" / "hr"
tc = 4.5 "sec" / (3600 "sec" / "hr")
ac = vc / tc
ac
"Time for Corvette to reach orbital velocity"
vs / ac 60 "min" / "hr"
\end{verbatim}

The result shows that the space shuttle accelerates
more than twice as fast as a Corvette.
