Eigenmath is a computer algebra system that provides a unified environment for symbolic manipulation, numerical computation, and visualization of mathematical objects. Here's a summary of its key features:<br><br>

* Supports a wide range of mathematical operations, including symbolic algebra, differential calculus, integral calculus, and matrix operations.<br><br>

* Can simplify expressions and verify equality of expressions using various techniques such as rationalization and cross-multiplication.<br><br>

* Provides methods for solving systems of linear equations.<br><br>

* Scripting language: allows users to write scripts that automate mathematical computations.<br><br>

* Extensive documentation and examples for getting started and exploring the system's capabilities.<br><br>

Eigenmath is designed to facilitate research in mathematics, physics, engineering, and other fields where symbolic manipulation, numerical computation, and visualization are essential. It aims to provide a powerful toolset for mathematicians, scientists, and engineers to explore complex mathematical concepts and solve problems efficiently.<br><br>
