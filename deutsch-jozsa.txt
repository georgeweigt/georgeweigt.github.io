-- M is measurement function, plots probability of observing each of 16 states

-- Hn is Hadamard operator on qbit n

-- Cmn is CNOT operator, m is control qbit, n is target qbit

-- ket0001 is the state with q3 = 1, all other qbits zero

"Constant oracle"

psi = dot(H3,H2,H1,H0,H3,H2,H1,H0,ket0001)

M(psi) -- measure

"Balanced oracle"

psi = dot(H3,H2,H1,H0,C23,C13,C03,H3,H2,H1,H0,ket0001)

M(psi) -- measure
